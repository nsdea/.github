# NSDEA (formerly nsde-archive)
This organization is actually just my ([@nsde](github.com/nsde)) place to deposit forks, inactive projects and more!

## Updates
### May 9th, 2022
I removed a repository because it could be used for malicious ("black hat") purposes:
- hax

### Important removal - Apr 27th, 2022
I just privated ~23 repositories because they included private information.
I'm not naming (all of) them to avoid people looking for cached archives.
Most of them weren't big projects anyways. This is why I'll just re-upload bigger projects, including:

- NeoVision
- ArgonCraft

Again, these are all private, not deleted! You can [contact](https://onlix.me/contact) me for info.
