# NSDEA (formerly nsde-archive)
This organization is actually just my ([@nsde](github.com/nsde)) place to deposit forks, inactive projects and more!

## Important Update - Apr 27, 2022
I just deleted ~23 repositories because they included private information.
I'm not naming (all of) them to avoid people looking for cached archives.
Most of them weren't big projects anyways. This is why I'll just re-upload bigger projects, including:

- NeoVision
- ArgonCraft
